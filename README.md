## üìñ API Documentation

Visit the interactive Swagger UI at:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
```

## üö® Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

Error responses include details:
```json

## üéØ Frontend Integration Tips

1. **Store JWT tokens** in localStorage or secure cookies
2. **Implement token refresh** before expiration
3. **Handle 401 errors** by redirecting to login
4. **Use pagination** for large lists
5. **Implement real-time updates** for grades and submissions
6. **Cache course sections** for better performance
7. **Use calendar events** for assignment/test deadlines
