## üéØ Frontend Integration Tips

1. **Store JWT tokens** in localStorage or secure cookies
2. **Implement token refresh** before expiration
3. **Handle 401 errors** by redirecting to login
4. **Use pagination** for large lists
5. **Implement real-time updates** for grades and submissions
6. **Cache course sections** for better performance
7. **Use calendar events** for assignment/test deadlines
